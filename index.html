    Umple - The Model-Oriented Programming Technology  
  </h1>
    <p>Umple is a technology to allow developers to add modeling abstractions to their code, or to start with
      a textual model and add code embedded in that model. Umple supports UML class and state diagrams as well as
      Java, PhP and C++. You can try it <a href="http://try.umple.org">online at UmpleOnline</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The master repository for Umple is currently hosted at <a href="http://code.umple.org">Google Code</a>
      and mirrored to <a href="http://github.com/umple/Umple">GitHub</a>.
