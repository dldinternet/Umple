This project contains the JET for generating java code using the cruise.umple 
tool. The only package within the /src directory which should compile is the 
cruise.umple.compiler.java which contains the working top level generating files.
the rest of the folders are simply there because JET requires that each template
be given a name and a package to put it into. Therefore, in essence, some of the
files in cruise.umple.compiler.java contain all the files in the other folders.

Contents of the cruise.umple.compiler.java folder need to be copied over the old 
contents in the same package name of cruise.umple. This is not done automatically.

Notice: In case this is not done automatically by your Eclipse version on your 
system, include the project cruise.umple in UmpleJetProject's build path. 

Umple to SDL Notes

- Umple namespaces correspond to packages in SDL;

- Umple models represent SDL specifications, each consisting of a set of packages and a system.

- Umple classes represent SDL types, with the followinf stereotypes representing the different kinds
of entity types in SDL. The members of an Umple Class represent different SDL type properties,
depending on the stereotype:

    - "system";
    - "block";
    - "process";
    - "procedure";
    - "interface";
    - "object";
    - "value";
    - "state";
    - "signal";
    
- Umple State Machines represent state machines of agents;

- An Umple association represents the corresponding concept in SDL.

- Generalization (isA construct) represents the corresponding specialisation in SDL;

- The 'use' construct represents an SDL dependency indicating a package using another package
