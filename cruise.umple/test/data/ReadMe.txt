Note that the examples here are also supposed to be the same as the examples in
the ump subdirectory of Umpleonline.

See http://code.google.com/p/umple/wiki/ModifyingUmpleOnlineExamples for details.

At some point we also want to ensure that all the examples in the user manual are
also automatically tested.
