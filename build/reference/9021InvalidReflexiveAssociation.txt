E021 Invalid Reflexive Association
Errors and Warnings
noreferences

@@description

<h2>Umple syntactic error reported when a class has a reflexive association (an association with both ends the same) but there is neither a role name (indicating it is asymmetric), nor a 'self' keyword (indicating it is symmetric).</h2>

<p>Code cannot be generated for asymmetric reflexive associations unless there is a role name at at least one end. This ensures the generated API has distinct words for each end.
