State Machine Actions and Do Activities

@@description
<p>      
When an transition is taken, an action can occur. This is indicated
using a slash "/" followed by arbitrary code in braces.
</p>

<p>
Similarly,
when entering or exiting a state, an action can occur. This is indicated
using the keywords entry or exit, followed by a slash, followed by code.
</p>

<p>The actions described above should take negligible time to execute.</p>

<p>If a longer-running computation or activity should run while in a state,
encode this using the keyword do, followed by code. In languages such as Java
that support it, a thread will be started
to invoke the thread. This allows the state machine to 'stay live'
and be able to respond to other events, even while the do activity is
running. Note that at the current time, the do activity thread must
terminate itself; as an enhancement, the do activity thread should be
interrupted and cancelled when a transition is taken out of the state.</p>
