<h2>Umple semantic error reported when a reflexive association has a 
multiplicity with a lower bound greater than one</h2>

<p> A <a href="ReflexiveAssociations.html">reflexive association</a> must 
have multiplicity with lower bounds of zero at both ends (e.g. *, 0.1 or 
or 0..2), otherwise an illogical situation would result. For example, 
creating a parent-child association on class Person (the example below) 
with a lower bound of 2 would mean that every Person in the system must 
have parents, <i>ad infinitum</i>.

</p>

// This example generates the error message
class Person {
