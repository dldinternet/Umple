<br />

<li><b><a href="isAclause.html">isA directives</a></b> that specify a superclass to your class (i.e. a Supervisor could be descrbied as "isA Person") [Interfaces can have more than one]</li>

<br />

<li><b><a href="SingletonPattern.html">A singleton directive</a></b> that limits the system to only one instance of this class (e.g. there may only be one Bank in a banking system)</li>
