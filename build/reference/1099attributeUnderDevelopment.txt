Aspects of attributes under development
Attributes
noreferences

@@description
<p>The unique keyword currently generates no code. In future
the intent is that it will force all values of an attribute in your
running program to be different.</p>

<p>The lazy keyword only currently works with immutable. There
have been requests to make it work with an ordinary attribute, such
that the attribute need not be initialized in the constructor, but
would have to be set before a call to get it.</p>

<p>If you discover any other problems or have requests please add an issue at
<a href="http://bugs.umple.org">bugs.umple.org.</a></p>
