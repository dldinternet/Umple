<h2>Umple semantic error related to a cycle found among traits</h2>

<p>In Umple, traits cannot be used in an explicit or implicit cyclic manner. It means that a trait cannot use itself and it also cannot be used in a cycle. This error happens when a hierarchy is created completely based on traits. Moreover, this issue generally arises because of invalid design or error in typing trait name. </p>
