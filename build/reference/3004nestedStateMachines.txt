<p>      
State machined can be nested inside another. This often allows for simpler Umple (or UML)
notation, since events that need to cause effects in every substate of the outer state do not have to be repeated in each of the substates.

<p>
The first example below illustrates nesting abstractly. The next example shows nesting in
a concrete example. The third example is the same as the second, but with no nesting, to
illustrate the difference.
