<h2>Umple semantic error reported when a class is designated as a subclass of itself, through some other class.</h2>

<p>The inheritance hierarchy cannot have cycles. It must be a strict tree. It is therefore not allowed to make a cycle or loop, in which a class is indirectly a subclass of itself.
