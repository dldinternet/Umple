Tracing Attributes with timeline

@@description
<p>
MOTL allows the manipulation of attributes tracing timeline. The "until" keyword triggers tracing and continues tracing of the attribute until the given condition is satisfied. On the other hand, the "after" keyword provides the opposite behaviour. Tracing will start once the given condition is satisfied and then continues indefinitely without any interruption.

// this example starts the tracing of attribute name and doesn't stop until condition becomes true

class Student
{
  name;
  trace name until name == "john";
