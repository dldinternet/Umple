Classes as Attribute Types

@@description
<p>You can declare a class as a data type of an attribute. This allows for
declaration of a 'containment' relationship.</p>

<p>If you use the methods in the <a href="APISummary.html">Umple-generated API</a> to access
the object stored in such an attribute, and pass this contained object
to some remote subsystem, then that remote subsystem will be able to affect the 
containing object in a backhanded sort of way. This is considered
<i>content coupling</i> in software engineering, and should be 
carefully controlled or avoided. We may in future add a capability
to Umple to ensure this cannot happen.</p>

<p>In the examples below, we show how using attribute notation
is very simular to using a directed association, except that
with attribute notation, you can set the value to null.</p>
