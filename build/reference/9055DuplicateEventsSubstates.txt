W055 Duplicate Events Within  Substates
Errors and Warnings

@@description

<h2>Umple warning generated when there is a duplicate unguarded event that will never be reached, in the situation where there is a superstate and a substate with the same event</h2>

<p>
In the example below, the event e from the s1 superstate and the event e in the s1a substate are ambiguous. Current semantics is that the event in the superstate takes precedence, but this semantics may be changed..
</p>

@@example

class X {
  sm {
    s1 {
      e-> s2;
      s1a {
        e-> s3;
      }
    }
    s2 {}
    s3 {}
  }
}
