<h2>Umple semantic warning generated when a directed association has a multiplicity with hard constraints</h2>

<p>Umple generates code to manage the manipulation of the directed end (with the arrowhead) of a directed association. However there are no inverse references in such a case. In the example below, there are no references from class B to class X. As a result, the multiplicity on the undirected end is purely 'documentation'. 
</p>

<p>
Specifying a hard constraint such as 1 or 2 for the upper or lower bound in such a case may be misleading and is typically incorrect. This error is raised whenever the multiplicity is other than * or 0..1  </p>
</p>

@@example
// The following will generate this warnbing

class X {
  1 -> * B first;
  1..3 -> * B second;
  0..2 -> * B third;
}

class B {}

// The following solves the problem by either making the association unndirected
