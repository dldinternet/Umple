<h2>Umple semantic error related to a cycle of trait use </h2>

<p>In Umple, traits cannot be used in an explicit or implicit cyclic way. This means that a trait cannot use itself and it also cannot be used in a cyclic hierarchy. This error happens when a hierarchy is created completely based on traits. Moreover, this issue generally arises because of invalid design or error in typing a trait name. </p>
