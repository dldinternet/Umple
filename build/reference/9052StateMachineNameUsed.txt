<h2>Umple semantic error reported when a state machine name matches the name of another element such as an association or attribute</h2>

<p>Since, in effect, a state machine defines a special kind of attribute (whose value is enumerated as one of the states and is controlled by events) it is not allowed to have an attribute or association with the same name as a state machine.
