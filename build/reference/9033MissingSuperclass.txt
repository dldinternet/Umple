<h2>Umple semantic warning issued when a referenced superclass is not found</h2>

<p>When you declare a superclass of a class, that class must exist. If the class does not exist, then this warning is issued.</p>

<p>It might be the case that the class is in fact declared in some code that is defined externally. In that case the existence of the external class should be made known to Umple using the external keyword;
</p>

// This example generates the warning since T is not defined
class S {
  isA T;

@@example
// This example solves the problem by defining T as an external class
// Umple will not generate any code for T, but now knows it exists
class S {
