@@description
<p>
MOTL allows developers to have control over attributes tracing using conditions. Injected trace code will not be activated unless the condition is satisfied. <br> 
Conditions can be a precondition or postcondition. <br>
<b> Precondition </b> <br>
Using "where" keyword, tracing code is injected with a precondition. 
<b> Postcondition </b> <br>
Using "giving" keyword, tracing code is injected with a postcondition. 
</p>
