<h2>Umple syntactic error or warning reported when an identifier does not have the correct syntax</h2>

<p>In Umple, identifiers used for classes, association role names, types, attributes, state machines, states, events and other elements must be alphanumeric. In addition, class and interface names should start with a capital letter (or _), and other elements should start with a lower case letter. The exact error message you received will tell you which identifier has the problem. The examples below will generate these messages.
