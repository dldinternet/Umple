W015 Immutable Class State Machine
Errors and Warnings

@@description

<h2>Umple semantic warning reported when an immutable class is defined as having a state machine.</h2>

<p>By definition, an immutable class can't change state, so it can't have a state machine. Any state machine defined is ignored.

</p>


@@example
// The following example shows how to generate this warning.
// Removing the immutable keyword will solve the problem.
class X {
  immutable;
  Integer y;
  sm {
    S1 {
    }
  }
