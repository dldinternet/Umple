Before and After Statements
Aspect Orientation
noreferences

@@description
<p>You can request that certain code be run before or after
various Umple-defined actions on attributes, associations and the
components of state machines. The ability to do this with methods
will be available soon, giving capabilities similar to aspect-oriented
languages.<p>

<p>Using 'before' allows you to enforce preconditions, such that 
the attribute or association will not be set if the precondition
is not true. To reject setting a value, add 'return false'.</p>

<p>You can add before and after clauses to add code to generated methods of the form getX, setX, addX, removeX, getXs (to get all elements of an association), numberOfXs, indexOfX, where X is the name of the attribute or association. You can also add code before and
after the constructor.</p>
