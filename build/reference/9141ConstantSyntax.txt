<h2>Umple syntactic warning reported when an attempt is made to initiate an attribute
with a value that does not match the type of the attribute</h2>

<p>Numbers must be initialized with numbers, strings with strings in double quotes, and Booleans with true or false. For Dates the value format is a string "yyyy-mm-dd"; for Times the format is "hh:mm:ss".
</p>

<p>
Note that for an initialization value with no type specified will result in the attribute having its type inferred from the vbalue. This is demonstrated in the third example.
</p>
