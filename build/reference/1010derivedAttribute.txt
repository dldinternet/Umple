@@description
<p>You can specify at arbitrary expression after the equals sign to create
an attribute that will be computed. There will be no set method on such
an attribute</p>

<p>Note that unless you use the simplest of expressions, you will be limited'
to only being able to generate code for the language of the expression.</p>

<p>You should make sure you call the 'get' methods provided in the Umple-generated
API (rather than directly accessing variables) and avoid having any side-effects in your expressions. Currently this is not enforced, but may be in the future</p>
