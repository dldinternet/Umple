This directory contains the static files that need to be deployed
to the directory /h/ralph/sites/www/html/umple on the server cruise.site.uottawa.ca
All these files (except this README) should be copied to the server when a deploy is done.

These files include the umple home page (index.html) and the support files that
it uses to display its content.

Note that user manual pages are added when the contents of this directory are deployed,
by the deploy process. See the instructions at https://code.google.com/p/umple/wiki/Deploying

Note also that the ElevatorPhP example should also be deployed into the umple directory.
That is found in the examples directory. The deployed files should have capitalization
ElevatorPhp

Note also that the cruise server's top level directory is maintained in a different svn
repossitory at the University of Ottawa, and other parts of the system, such as umpleonline
are maintained separately too.
