<p>This proposal is in the Project Proposal Phase (as defined in the
Eclipse Development Process) and is written to declare its intent and
scope. We solicit additional participation and input from the Eclipse

<h2>Background</h2>

<!-- 
	Optionally provide the background that has lead you to creating this project.
 -->







<h2>Scope</h2>

<!-- 
	All projects must have a well-defined scope. Describe, concisely, what
	is in-scope and (optionally) what is out-of-scope. An Eclipse project
	cannot have an open-ended scope.
 -->

The Umple project encompasses in short, a model compiler and related techology: Specifically:

  The textual programming-language-like syntax called Umple, covering
    UML constructs, including associations, attributes, state machines, components,  consraints, concurrency, etc.
    Real-time profiles such as Marte and AutoSar
    Patterns
    Separation of concerns in the context of Umple including mixins, aspect-oriented code injections, and variability modeling constructs
    A tracing sublanguage (MOTL) allowing injection of tracepoints into modeling constructs

  Technology for embedding Umple in programming languages such as Java, PhP, Ruby and C++

  Technology for embedding code in such programming languages, plus Alf, into Umple

  A grammar DSL optimized for processing Umple and the embedding of languages, but also capable of being used in other contexts

  A subsystem for analysing the syntactic and semantic validity of models in Umple

  Code generation capabilities related to Umple
    A generic code-generation architecture designed to work with Umple, but also capable of working with other modeling front-ends
    Specific code generators for Java, PhP, Ruby, C++, covering all the syntactic elements described above
    Generators for creating UML diagrams from Umple
    Generators for exporting other UML representations (XMI, Yuml, etc.), SDL and SQL
    Generators for metrics and other data about Umple systems
    Generators for formal languages

  An Eclipse plugin supporting all of the above

  An XText-based plugin to give Umple improved syntax-directed editing, and a tool to convert the Umple grammar to XText

  A website (UmpleOnline) for editing Umple and UML diagrams interchangeably and generating code and other artifacts

  Metadata for the Umple user manual, and a tool to generate the user manual from this metadata

  Tools to generate self-documenting elements of the Umple compiler

  A User-Interface generation tool (UIGU) to generate usable default websites from any given Umple model for rapid prototyping

  A tool to facilitate transformation of code to Umple models+code (umplification)

  An extensive suite of testcases to test the syntax, Umple metamodel, and generated code

  Example systems written in Umple to serve as additional tests

  Plugins to various external editors to provide those editors with an Umple profile



<h2>Description</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe the project here. Be concise, but provide enough information that
	somebody who doesn't already know very much about your project idea or domain
	has at least a fighting chance of understanding its purpose.
 -->
 
<h2>Why Eclipse?</h2> 

<!-- 
	Answer these two questions:	What value does this project bring to the Eclipse
	community? What value do you expect to obtain from hosting your project at Eclipse?
	
	What value do you get by having your project at Eclipse over and above the value
	of hosting at Eclipse Labs?
 -->

Umple has been developed as a stand-alone project over the last five years, with the sponsorship of IBM and contributions to support the development of various components by other companies.

Although rigorous quality has been built into the compiler using test-driven development and by writing the compiler in itself, we need the visibility and IP policies that an organization like Eclipse can provide, in order to help foster industrial uptake.

Since Umple has been developed in Eclipse, and has an Eclipse plugin as one of its main artifacts, the Eclipse foundation seems the right home.

Also according to XXXX Eclipse is one of the most open of open-source initiatives. Umple has always prided itself in being extremely open, and we want this to continue.


<h2>Initial Contribution</h2>

<!-- 
	Projects are expected to arrive at Eclipse with existing code.
	
	Describe the existing code that will be contributed to the project. Please provide
	a couple of paragraphs describing the code with modest detail, including important
	information like code ownership (who holds the copyright?), and some consideration
	of community that exists around the code. Include a listing of third-party libraries 
	and associated licenses.
 -->

Umple has been an open source project under Google Code since 2011. It is licensed under the MIT license. Copyright is jointly held by the contributors, who, by virtue of agreeing to release their contributions under the MIT license have allowed their work to be freely used.


 
<h2>Legal Issues</h2>

<!-- 
	Please describe any potential legal issues in this section. Does somebody else
	own the trademark to the project name? Is there some issue that prevents you
	from licensing the project under the Eclipse Public License? Are parts of the 
	code available under some other license? Are there any LGPL/GPL bits that you
	absolutely require?
 -->
 
There should be no important legal issues that we are aware of. The project is under the MIT license. We have no objection to converting to the Eclipse Public License going forward. 

The project does have dependencies on some other Eclipse projects (e.g. Jet). The website also uses CodeMirror and JQuery which are licensed under the MIT license.

There is the issue of the generated code. When code is emitted it no license is injected, Our concept is that the original model can have whatever license users want, and the generated code would have the same license.
 
<h2>Committers</h2>

<!-- 
	List any initial committers that should be provisioned along with the
	new project. Include affiliation, but do not include email addresses at
	this point.
 -->

<p>The following individuals are proposed as initial committers to the project:</p>

<dl>
	<dt>Committer 1, Affiliation</dt>
	<dd>Committer 1 is a committer on the *** project where he has made significant contributions over
	many years. S/he will be contribute to the *** functionality in this new project.</dd>
	<dt>Committer 2, Affiliation</dt>
	<dd>Committer 2 has provided significant contributions to the existing code base. S/he will contribute
	to the *** functionality in this new project.
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>We welcome additional committers and contributions.</p>

<!-- 
	Describe any initial contributions of code that will be brought to the 
	project. If there is no existing code, just remove this section.
 -->

<h2>Mentors</h2>

<!-- 
	New Eclipse projects require a minimum of two mentors from the Architecture
	Council. You need to identify two mentors before the project is created. The
	proposal can be posted before this section is filled in (it's a little easier
	to find a mentor when the proposal itself is public).
 -->

<p>The following Architecture Council members will mentor this
project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ian Bull</li>
	<li>To be determined</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interested Parties</h2>

<!-- 
	Provide a list of individuals, organisations, companies, and other Eclipse
	projects that are interested in this project. This list will provide some
	insight into who your project's community will ultimately include. Where
	possible, include affiliations. Do not include email addresses.
 -->

<p>The following individuals, organisations, companies and projects have 
expressed interest in this project:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Somebody, Affiliation</li>
	<li>Somebody else, Affiliation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Project Scheduling</h2>

<!-- 
	Describe, in rough terms, what the basic scheduling of the project will
	be. You might, for example, include an indication of when an initial contribution
	should be expected, when your first build will be ready, etc. Exact
	dates are not required.
 -->

We would like to convert to Eclipse in midsummer (July). We will route all commits to Coogle Code and also to Eclipse until the Eclipse site is stable.
