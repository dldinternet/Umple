// This first example uses attribute notation
// The address is required on the constructor, but can be null
// An instance of Address can be considered to be contained
// within the Person class.

// Although there is nothing currently preventing the same address
// from being re-used in multiple classes, it is strongly suggested
// to avoid that. If you want to reuse the same Address, then use
// association notation instead.

// Contrast this example with the previous one
// Here we use a directed association instead of an attribute.
// Note that the multiplicity on the left is of no relevance.
// It is conventional to show it as * to indicate that the
//  value could be attached to several objects.
//
// Here when you construct a Person, the address cannot be
// null.
