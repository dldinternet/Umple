// The following will generate this error

class P1 {}
class P2 {}

class Sub {
  isA P1, P2;
}
// The following is another way of formulating the same declarations, also resulting in the error

class P1 {}
class P2 {}

class Sub {
  isA P1;
  isA P2;
}


// If all but one of the parents is declared as an Interface, the problem is solved

interface P1 {}
class P2 {}

class Sub {
  isA P1;
  isA P2;
}
