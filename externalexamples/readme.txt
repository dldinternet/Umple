This directory is intended to contain code for projects that use Umple, but are not
part of the Umple project itself.

We invite people to create their own umple examples, with proper test cases included.
We can then build them automatically. That way we can help ensure that as we update
the compiler it doesn't break your code, and also your code serves as additional
test cases for us.
